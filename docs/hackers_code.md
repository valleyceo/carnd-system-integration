## Hacker's Code

Here are some minimal structure which will save everyone's time and maximize team synergy.  

#### Coding practices  
1. Keep it simple and easy.
	- Einstein once said "if you cannot explain something to a child, you probably do not fully understand it".  
2. Keep it traceable.
	- If you used an external code or an algorithm, please try to explain, or at least give source on where you got it. Perhaps someone else who goes over could explain it better.  
3. Document and comment..
	- Let's document/comment as much (and clean) as we can so that everyone can follow easily.  
4. Respect each other.
	- Ok.. That was too obvious.  
5. Enjoy!
	- Perhaps the most important one :).  

#### Commitment  
Although I don't mind if you prefer specializing on a specific topic, I highly encourage everyone to understand and go over the whole project as this project is called "systems integration". Trust me, you will most likely not go back to re-learn once we have passed.  

#### Simple tools to get the ball rolling  
- Pick a topic (from to do list) and dive.  
- Create a to do list for others (please try to hack the problem into realistic ones).  
- Go over codes and see if you can improve it.  
	
#### Github Repository Management  
- Let's keep every work in "master" branch, if multiple ideas are possible, we can simply document both ways and use the better one.  
- Only if you are trying other way or version, you can branch out.  
- Don't be afraid to commit and screw up the repository.. We are hackers, and that is probably a normal thing.  

#### Communication channel  
- If you are lightly stuck -> Slack.  
- If you are stuck on something big -> Github tags. 
- To do lists -> Github tags.
